A comprehensive introduction to Python programming with hands-on practice exercises.

## Overview

This folder contains materials from the Udemy "Python Programming for Beginners with Hands-On Practice" course, designed to teach Python fundamentals to newcomers.

## Course Contents

- **Course- Python Programming for Beginners with Hands-On Practice - Udemy.url** — Link to the official Udemy course
- **README.md** — Course overview and resources
- **Project Action Items.md** — Tracking list for course projects and exercises
- **PODS-JSON-Code.code-workspace** — VS Code workspace configuration for course projects

## Topics Covered

- Python syntax and basic concepts
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Working with data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- File I/O and exception handling
- Object-oriented programming basics
- Hands-on practice exercises and projects

## Getting Started

1. **Open the workspace:** 
   - Use `File > Open Workspace from File` in VS Code
   - Select `PODS-JSON-Code.code-workspace`

2. **Follow the course:** 
   - Watch the Udemy course videos
   - Complete the hands-on exercises provided in each section
   - Run Python scripts to see results

3. **Practice exercises:**
   - Check `Project Action Items.md` for current projects and tasks
   - Write your own Python scripts to reinforce concepts
   - Test your code using the integrated terminal

## Running Python Scripts

Using VS Code integrated terminal:

```bash
python hello.py
```

Or use the Python extension to run files directly.

## Key Python Concepts

- **Print and input:** `print()` and `input()` functions
- **Data types:** int, float, str, bool, list, dict, tuple
- **Loops:** for and while loops
- **Functions:** Define and call reusable code blocks
- **Modules:** Import and use built-in and custom modules
- **Error handling:** Try/except blocks for robust code

## Resources

- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) — Tutorials and guides

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice regularly:** Write code every day to build muscle memory
2. **Experiment:** Modify examples and see what happens
3. **Read error messages:** They provide valuable clues for debugging
4. **Use the debugger:** VS Code has built-in debugging tools
5. **Join communities:** r/learnprogramming, Stack Overflow for questions
